# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: React 19, Tailwind CSS v3.4.17
**Primary Dependencies**: GSAP 3 (ScrollTrigger), Lucide React
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: [e.g., vitest, playwright or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: Mobile-first Web
**Project Type**: Web Application Landing Page
**Performance Goals**: 60fps animations, fast LCP for mobile
**Constraints**: No Tailwind unless explicitly required, single App.jsx unless >600 lines
**Scale/Scope**: High-fidelity, cinematic 1:1 pixel-perfect implementation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[ ] I. Premium Aesthetic Foundation (0.05 opacity noise, Otulenie Calm palette, correct typography)
[ ] II. The Focus on Conversion (Supports primary booking action on Booksy)
[ ] III. Micro-Interaction Polish (Magnetic buttons, GSAP animations in useEffect contexts)
[ ] IV. Mobile-First Experience (Vertical stacking, sticky CTA)

  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
